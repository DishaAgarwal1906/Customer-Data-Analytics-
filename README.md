# Customer Purchase Analytics
## Project Overview
This project explores customer purchase behavior to answer three key questions:

Will the customer buy products or not?
If yes, which brand will the customer choose?
How many products will the customer likely buy?
The solution leverages K-Means Clustering and Logistic Regression to analyze customer data and predict these outcomes.

## Key Features
Predict Purchase Decision: Using logistic regression, determine if a customer will buy a product based on features like demographics, past behavior, and preferences.
Brand Prediction: Employ clustering via K-Means to group customers and infer their likely brand preference.
Quantity Estimation: Analyze patterns in the dataset to estimate how many products a customer might purchase.

## Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
scikit-learn (for clustering and regression)
pandas and numpy (for data manipulation)
matplotlib and seaborn (for visualization)
Kmeans And Logistic Regression

## Dataset
Provide details about the dataset (e.g., features, size, and source). Example:
Features: Age, Gender, Income, Purchase History, Product Category, etc.
Source: Simulated or real-world data

## Methodology
Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values, standardized numerical data, and encoded categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualized trends and patterns to gain insights into customer preferences.
K-Means Clustering:
Segmented customers into clusters based on behavioral and demographic features.
Mapped clusters to specific brands to predict customer preferences.
Logistic Regression:
Trained a binary classification model to predict whether a customer will purchase.
Product Quantity Analysis:
Analyzed trends in purchase volumes using clustering insights and regression techniques.
